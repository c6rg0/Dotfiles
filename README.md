Dotfiles - configuration files which are traditionally stored in files/folders whose filename starts with a dot (.config).

# My configuation files for my laptop:

List of technologies:
- Neovim - extensible command line text editor, the config file includes plugins and themes,
- Hyprland - highly customizable window tiler; automatically divides windows into perfect sections (shown in screenshots),

- Rofi - a light application launcher
- Kitty - terminal emulator
- Fastfetch - just shows specs and info
- zsh - command line shell
- p10k - cli plugin for aesthetics (responsible for the coloured bar)
